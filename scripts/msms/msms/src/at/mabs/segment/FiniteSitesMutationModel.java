 * single place to put all the generic pieces of a mutation model.

 * In particular this is a very generic model. That is you have a Q matrix,
 * number of states, mutation rate, mapping between state and
 * 'char', and a gamma model--If you need one.
 * <p>
 * The interface deals with turning say a GTR model into a valid Q matrix.
